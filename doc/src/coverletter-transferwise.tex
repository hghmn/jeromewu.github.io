\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Passionate problem solver, enthusiastic about software technologies, team leader with over 3 years of experience in innovative software solution development and manufacturing industry in an international environment.

Coordinate over 10 internal application development projects and play as an architect in software system architecture design. Excel in leadership, critical thinking, communication and software engineering. Strong skills in JavaScript (incl. React, React-Native, Redux, ES6), major contributor of tesseract.js (17k+ stars on Github) now. Certified architecting, data engineering, big data and machine learning specializations in Google Cloud Platform.

\lettersection{Why TransferWise?}
TransferWise impresses me deeply in the way it revolutionizes how we exchange currencies between different countries. In the past, it cost much and the bank took lots of commissions from us. And I think it is pretty smart to resovle this issue with a platform which enables peer-to-peer exchange with a small commission, and it helps people working abroad to send their money back to their home without too much loss.

Technically, I think massive transactions happened every second inside TransferWise platform is a critical technical issue to resolve and also lots of machine learning models can be applied to further extract knowledge to grow the business, it seems to me that there are lots of challenges and opportunities in TransferWise and I would love to confront.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
With solid technical skills and years of leading engineering team collaborating with cross-functional teams to develop various projects, I believe I am capable of operating with enthusiasm and flexibility in a fast-paced, constantly evolving team environment. I think that is exactly the challenge of being a technical lead in TransferWise.
